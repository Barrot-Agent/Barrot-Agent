3. Review system health in real-time-monitoring
4. Restart assessment cycle manually if needed

### If Gaps Not Being Filled
1. Check gap_filling status in cognition-engine
2. Verify source availability (18 sources)
3. Review synthesis_queue for blockages
4. Check validation_protocol thresholds

### If Performance Degrades
1. Review real-time-monitoring thresholds
