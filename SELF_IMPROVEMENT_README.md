## How It Works

### Continuous Improvement Cycle

```
AI Field Monitoring → Methodology Assessment → Recursive Learning 
        ↓                                              ↓
Feedback Loop ← Cognitive Evaluation ← Problem-Solving Refinement
```

### Key Processes

1. **Discovery & Assessment**: New methodologies/algorithms/technologies are continuously discovered from multiple sources and assessed using a multi-criteria framework.

2. **Learning & Integration**: Validated improvements are integrated through a 4-layer recursive learning model that processes feedback from milliseconds to hours.

3. **Monitoring & Adaptation**: The system monitors the AI field in real-time, tracking competitors, research, and benchmarks to identify opportunities and threats.

4. **Refinement & Optimization**: Problem-solving capabilities are continuously refined using adaptive algorithms including genetic algorithms, neural architecture search, reinforcement learning, and more.

5. **Evaluation & Validation**: All responses and cognitive models are evaluated against cutting-edge standards using weighted metrics across 5 dimensions.
