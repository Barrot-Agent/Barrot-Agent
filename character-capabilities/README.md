## Character Profiles

### Movies
- **Iron Man (Tony Stark)** - AI orchestration, energy optimization, modular architecture
- **The Matrix (Neo)** - Deep system analysis, performance optimization, self-healing systems

### Books
- **Dune (Paul Atreides)** - Predictive analytics, high-performance computing, command execution

## Capability Transformation Process

### 1. Character Analysis
- Identify fictional abilities and powers
- Categorize by type (physical, mental, technological, etc.)
- Document source material and context

### 2. Real-World Mapping
- Map each ability to practical technology
- Identify underlying principles
- Find existing implementations or inspirations

### 3. Framework Integration
- Design framework features based on abilities
- Create technical specifications
- Plan implementation approach

### 4. Impact Assessment
- Evaluate potential benefits
- Assess implementation complexity
- Prioritize capabilities
