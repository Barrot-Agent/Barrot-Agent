### Step 3: Product Type (10 seconds)

### Step 4: Upload Product Files (2-3 minutes)
**Option A: Upload folder directly** (if Gumroad supports)
- Click "Upload files"
- Select entire `github-actions-bundle` folder

- Name it: `github-actions-workflow-bundle.zip`
- In Gumroad, click "Upload files"
- Select the ZIP file
- Wait for upload (should be < 1 MB, takes seconds)

**What's included in the ZIP**:
- 5 workflow YAML files
- README.md with instructions
- All ready to use

### Step 5: Product Details (5-7 minutes)

**Product Name**:
```
GitHub Actions Workflow Bundle - 5 Production-Ready CI/CD Workflows
```

**Product Description**:
- Open file: `marketing/product-1-description.md`
- Copy EVERYTHING from "Stop Wasting Hours..." onwards
- Paste into Gumroad's description field
- The description is **already optimized** - don't change it!

**Price**:
- Enter: `$29`
- Currency: USD
- Leave suggested price empty (or set to $39 if you want)

**Short Description** (for product card):
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Can't upload files
- **Solution**: Check file size. If ZIP is > 50MB, you may need to remove something. Current bundle should be < 1MB.

**Problem**: Description formatting looks weird
- **Solution**: Gumroad supports Markdown. The description is pre-formatted for this.

**Problem**: Don't see "Publish" button
- **Solution**: Scroll down. Make sure all required fields are filled (name, price, files).

**Problem**: Want to edit after publishing
- **Solution**: You can! Go to Products → Select your product → Edit. Update anytime.
