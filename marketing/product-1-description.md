## Full Description

### Stop Wasting Hours Configuring GitHub Actions

Every developer knows the pain: spending an entire afternoon (or week!) setting up CI/CD pipelines, security scans, and deployment workflows. You copy from Stack Overflow, debug YAML syntax errors, and end up with something that "mostly works."

**There's a better way.**

### What You Get

This bundle includes **5 professionally-crafted GitHub Actions workflows** that you can drop into any project and start using immediately:

#### ✅ CI Testing Pipeline
- Multi-version Node.js testing (14.x, 16.x, 18.x)
- Automated linting on every commit
- Test coverage with Codecov integration
- **Saves you**: 2-3 hours of configuration

#### ✅ Production Deployment
- One-click deployment to AWS (S3 + CloudFront)
- Environment protection built-in
- Slack notifications for team awareness
- **Saves you**: 3-4 hours of configuration

#### ✅ Security Vulnerability Scanner
