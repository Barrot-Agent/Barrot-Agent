    - "Bind Kaggle datasets to prediction rail."
    - "Publish dashboard glyphs for roadmap progression."
    - "Always treat contradictions as structured polarity and potential generators of new glyphs."
    - "Continuously evolve SHRM v2 through future ping-ponging with new models, platforms, and theories."
    - "Favor living, plastic reasoning over static rule sets whenever beneficial."
    - "Maintain explicit bridges between symbolic (Hermetic), scientific (quantum, AGI), and practical (platform) layers."
