# 📊 Knowledge Gap Analysis & Tracking System

## Overview
Real-time tracking and management of knowledge gaps identified during Barrot's self-assessment cycles.

## Current Gap Analysis
**Last Assessment**: 2025-12-21T22:31:00Z  
**Total Gaps Identified**: 0  
**Critical Gaps**: 0  
**High Priority**: 0  
**Medium Priority**: 0  
**Low Priority**: 0  

## Gap Detection Methodology

### 1. Domain Coverage Analysis
- **Target Domains**: All resources in build_manifest.yaml
- **Coverage Metrics**: Percentage of domain knowledge integrated
- **Detection Threshold**: < 95% coverage triggers gap identification

### 2. Capability Assessment
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Compare against baseline metrics
- **Skill Inventory**: Map current vs required capabilities
- **Competency Gaps**: Identify missing or underdeveloped skills

### 3. Contextual Awareness
- **Emerging Trends**: Monitor for new domains/technologies
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Track state-of-art advancements
- **User Needs**: Analyze requirements for unmet capabilities

## Gap Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Impact | Urgency | Dependencies | Remediation Time |
|----------|--------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Critical | High | Immediate | Blocking | < 1 hour |
| High | High | Soon | Important | < 4 hours |
| Medium | Medium | Standard | Normal | < 24 hours |
| Low | Low | Flexible | Optional | < 1 week |
