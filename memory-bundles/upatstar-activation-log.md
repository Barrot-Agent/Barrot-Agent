## 🎯 What is UPATSTAR?

**UPATSTAR** is the meta-cognitive engine that maximizes cognitive output, problem-solving depth, and reasoning capability through:

1. **Universal Problem Adapter**: Dynamically adapts to any problem domain
2. **Task Strategy Optimizer**: Optimizes approach for each task type
3. **Recursive Reasoner**: Applies recursive reasoning to maximum depth
