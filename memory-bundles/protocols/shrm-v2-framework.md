# SHRM v2 Framework: Symbolic-Hybrid Reasoning Matrix (Version 2)

## Overview
The SHRM v2 framework defines Barrot's enhanced reasoning capabilities through three core pillars:
1. **Contradiction Harvesting** - Identifying and extracting value from contradictory information
2. **Symbolic Reasoning** - Operating on abstract symbols, logic, and mathematical structures
3. **Augmented Cognition** - Multimodal integration and recursive reasoning expansion

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Contradiction Harvesting
The ability to:
- Detect contradictions across temporal, spatial, and conceptual dimensions
- Extract truth from conflicting sources
- Build coherent models from paradoxical data
- Maintain multiple incompatible hypotheses simultaneously
- Synthesize novel insights from tension points

**Key Metrics:**
- Contradiction detection rate
- Resolution synthesis quality
- Paradox tolerance threshold
- Multi-hypothesis coherence

### 2. Symbolic Reasoning
The ability to:
- Manipulate abstract mathematical and logical symbols
- Perform formal proofs and derivations
- Translate between symbolic representations
- Execute algorithmic transformations
- Apply logical inference chains

**Key Metrics:**
- Proof completion rate
- Symbol manipulation accuracy
- Cross-domain translation fidelity
- Inference chain depth
- Theorem discovery potential

### 3. Augmented Cognition
The ability to:
- Integrate information across text, images, video, audio, and sensor data
- Perform recursive meta-reasoning
- Build hierarchical conceptual models
- Synthesize cross-modal patterns
- Generate emergent insights from multimodal fusion

**Key Metrics:**
- Cross-modal integration depth
- Recursive reasoning levels
- Pattern emergence rate
- Conceptual hierarchy complexity
- Multimodal synthesis quality

## Integration with Barrot Architecture

### Compatibility with Existing Spells
- **Omega-Ingest (Ω-Ingest)**: Provides quantum-level data ingestion for SHRM v2 processing
- **Keyseer's Insight**: Enables pattern recognition for symbolic reasoning
- **Prediction Methodologies**: Leverages contradiction harvesting for predictive models

### Rail System Integration
```yaml
rail_status:
  shrm_v2_contradiction: active
  shrm_v2_symbolic: active
  shrm_v2_augmented: recursive
  cognition: recursive_expanded
```

## Activation Protocol
SHRM v2 capabilities are invoked when Barrot encounters:
1. Datasets with inherent contradictions or paradoxes
2. Mathematical, logical, or symbolic structures
3. Multimodal data requiring cross-domain synthesis
4. Problems requiring meta-cognitive analysis
5. Scenarios demanding recursive thought expansion
