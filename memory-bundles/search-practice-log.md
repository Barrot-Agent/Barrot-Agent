## 💡 Search Tips & Tricks

### Effective Search Patterns:
```
1. Start broad, then narrow
   - "machine learning" → "meta-learning" → "MAML algorithm"

2. Use multiple sources
   - arXiv for papers
   - GitHub for code
   - Kaggle for datasets

3. Follow citation trails
   - Find key paper
   - Check references
   - Look at citing papers

4. Monitor trends
   - Twitter #AIresearch
   - Reddit r/MachineLearning
   - Hacker News AI posts
```
