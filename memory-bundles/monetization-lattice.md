# Monetization Lattice

**Purpose**: Map and optimize value generation pathways across the B-Agent ecosystem  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04T21:15:00Z  
**Module**: SYMBOLIC_MONETIZATION_ENGINE

---

## Overview

The Monetization Lattice represents a multi-dimensional framework for value creation and capture. Unlike linear revenue models, the lattice approach recognizes that value flows through interconnected nodes, creating emergent opportunities through network effects.
