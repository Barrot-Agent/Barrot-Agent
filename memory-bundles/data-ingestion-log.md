**Source**: Main Character Energy: 2025 trend recap
**Category**: Cultural Trends & Social Media Analysis
**URL**: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2025/12/26/main-character-energy-2025-trend-recap/
**Type**: Blog Article
**Description**: Analysis of the Main Character Energy (MCE) cultural trend that defined 2025, covering Gen Z and Gen Alpha digital behavior, self-presentation, identity formation, and the shift from constant self-optimization to sustainable authenticity. Includes statistical data on social media usage, marketing implications, and the emergence of "main character burnout."
**Key Topics**: 
- Main Character Energy philosophy and cultural impact
- Gen Z and Gen Alpha behavioral trends
- Social media usage patterns (Pinterest, TikTok, Instagram)
- Mental health and burnout considerations
- Marketing and brand adoption strategies
- Soft rebellion against hustle culture
**Value**: Understanding modern cultural trends, Gen Z behavior patterns, social media dynamics, and emerging counter-movements
**Status**: Ingested

**Source**: A ghostly glow was seen emanating from living things in 2025
**Category**: Scientific Research - Biophysics & Cellular Biology
**URL**: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2502978-a-ghostly-glow-was-seen-emanating-from-living-things-in-2025/
**Type**: Scientific Article
**Description**: Comprehensive study by University of Calgary and National Research Council of Canada confirming ultraweak photon emission (UPE) or "biophotons" from all living organisms. Research demonstrates that living cells emit faint light due to biochemical processes, particularly oxidative metabolism in mitochondria. The glow vanishes at death, distinguishing living from non-living matter.
**Key Topics**:
- Ultraweak photon emission (UPE) and biophotons
- Cellular metabolism and oxidative processes
- Reactive oxygen species and photon generation
- Life-death distinction at cellular level
- Potential diagnostic and agricultural applications
- Quantum biology implications
**Value**: Understanding fundamental life processes, potential non-invasive diagnostics, biomedical research applications, quantum biology insights
**Status**: Ingested
**Integration**: Active

**Source**: A rare cancer-fighting plant compound has finally been decoded
**Category**: Scientific Research - Biochemistry & Drug Development
**URL**: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082728.htm
**Type**: Scientific Article
**Description**: Breakthrough research from University of British Columbia Okanagan identifying two key enzymes responsible for synthesizing mitraphylline, a rare spirooxindole alkaloid with anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. The discovery decodes the natural biosynthesis process in tropical plants (Mitragyna/kratom and Uncaria/cat's claw), enabling sustainable production of this valuable compound.
**Key Topics**:
- Mitraphylline biosynthesis pathway
- Spirooxindole alkaloids chemistry
- Enzyme identification and function
- Plant-based drug development
