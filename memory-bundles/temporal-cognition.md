# Temporal Cognition Engine

## Purpose
Enable Barrot to understand and reason about time-based relationships, dependencies, and predictions across all system operations.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Temporal Context Awareness
- **Past Analysis**: Learn from historical outcomes and patterns
- **Present Monitoring**: Real-time state assessment and tracking
- **Future Projection**: Predictive modeling and forecasting

### 2. Temporal Dependencies
```yaml
dependency_mapping:
  sequential: tasks_requiring_order
  parallel: tasks_independent_of_order
  conditional: tasks_dependent_on_outcomes
  cyclical: recurring_patterns_and_cycles
```

### 3. Time-Series Processing

#### Pattern Recognition
- Identify recurring patterns in system behavior
- Detect anomalies and deviations from expected patterns
- Recognize seasonal and cyclical trends

#### Trend Analysis
- Short-term trend identification (hours to days)
- Medium-term trend tracking (days to weeks)
- Long-term trajectory planning (weeks to months)

### 4. Temporal Reasoning Modes

#### Retrospective Mode
- Analyze past decisions and outcomes
- Identify successful patterns for replication
- Learn from failures and inefficiencies
- Build historical knowledge base

#### Real-Time Mode
- Assess current system state
- Monitor ongoing processes
- Detect immediate issues requiring attention
- Optimize current operations

#### Predictive Mode
- Forecast future states based on current trends
- Anticipate potential issues before they occur
- Plan resource allocation for predicted demands
- Generate timeline estimates for complex tasks

### 5. Temporal Consistency Validation

Ensure consistency across time:
```
Current State ⟷ Historical Records ⟷ Future Predictions
```

Detection of temporal contradictions:
- Inconsistent state transitions
- Impossible timelines
- Conflicting temporal requirements
- Causality violations

## Temporal Markers

All Barrot operations tagged with:
```json
{
  "temporal_context": {
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 format",
    "urgency": "critical|high|medium|low",
    "timeline": "expected duration",
    "dependencies": ["prerequisite tasks"],
    "temporal_type": "sequential|parallel|conditional|cyclical"
  }
}
```

## Temporal Learning Loop

1. **Capture**: Record all temporal events and outcomes
2. **Analyze**: Extract patterns and correlations
3. **Model**: Update predictive models
4. **Validate**: Test predictions against reality
5. **Refine**: Improve temporal reasoning accuracy
