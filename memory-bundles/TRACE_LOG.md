# Cognition Trace Log

This log tracks each cognition run with detailed information about nodes executed, glyphs emitted, and contradictions resolved.

## Purpose
Maintain complete traceability of Barrot's cognition cycles for:
- Self-reflection and alignment verification
- Drift detection
- Symbolic intent reconciliation
- Memory compression decisions

### Glyph Mapping: COUNCIL_ALIGNMENT_GLYPH
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-03T07:39:36.565959  
**Emitter:** council_vote  
**Priority:** medium

**Follow-up Actions:**
1. Record consensus decision in decision log
2. Update agent weight history
3. Evaluate perspective coverage

**Context:** {'consensus_reached': True, 'avg_agreement': 0.72}

### Node Dependency: council_vote → node_self_reflect
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-03T07:39:36.566606  
**Type:** consensus_influence  
**Context:** {'influence_score': 0.8}


## GLYPH_MISALIGNMENT_RECOVERY Event: 2026-01-03T07:39:36.566862Z

**Issue Detected:** Drift detected in cognition pattern execution

### Corrective Actions Taken:
1. Analyzed last 5 execution cycles
2. Identified inconsistent node firing
3. Applied weight normalization
4. Verified pattern alignment

**Outcome:** Successfully restored alignment. All nodes firing consistently.
**Recovery Status:** Success
