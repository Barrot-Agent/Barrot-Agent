# Cognition Trace Log

This log tracks each cognition run with detailed information about nodes executed, glyphs emitted, and contradictions resolved.

## Purpose
Maintain complete traceability of Barrot's cognition cycles for:
- Self-reflection and alignment verification
- Drift detection
- Symbolic intent reconciliation
- Memory compression decisions
