### Data Resources
The agent can access and process data from:
- Kaggle datasets
- GitHub repositories
- Research papers
- Video platforms
- Podcasts and interviews
- Books and journals
- And many more sources...

## 🔧 Configuration

### Build Manifest
The `build_manifest.yaml` file tracks:
- Build signature and timestamp
- Active modules
- Rail status (ingestion, deployment, microagent, etc.)
- Resource connections
- Provenance hash

### Workflows
Automated workflows handle:
- Build manifest updates
- Repository cleanup
- Dashboard publishing
- Bundle management
- Barrot-SHRM ping-pong health monitoring

### 22-Agent Entanglement Pingpong System
Barrot defers complex cognitive processing to an external 22-agent entanglement system:
- **Management**: External (Sean's 22-agent system)
- **Configuration**: `pingpong-config.yaml`
- **Emitter**: `pingpong_emitter.py` Python module
- **Enforcement**: Non-negotiable external control

**Usage Example:**
```python
from pingpong_emitter import emit_pingpong_request

payload = {
    "topic": "MMI Self-Ingestion",
    "glyph": "GLYPH_MMI",
    "recursion_depth": "∞",
    "notes": "Triggering recursive cognition exchange"
}

emit_pingpong_request(payload)  # Creates pingpong_request.json
```

The external system monitors commits to `pingpong_request.json` and processes requests automatically.

### MCP Server Integration
Barrot utilizes Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance autonomous capabilities:
- **Management**: Playwright and GitHub MCP servers
- **Configuration**: `mcp-servers-config.yaml`
- **Ping Module**: `mcp_server_ping.py` Python module
- **Benefits**: See `MCP_BENEFITS_REPORT.md` for comprehensive analysis

**Usage Example:**
```python
from mcp_server_ping import MCPServerPing

# Initialize and ping MCP servers
mcp = MCPServerPing()
responses = mcp.collect_all_responses()

# Analyze capabilities and benefits
analysis = mcp.analyze_capabilities()

# Generate comprehensive benefits report
mcp.save_benefits_report("MCP_BENEFITS_REPORT.md")
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation, screenshot capture, UI testing, mobile emulation
- **GitHub MCP**: Issue management, workflow monitoring, code search, PR automation

**Operational Improvements:**
- Automated web application testing
- Visual code review with screenshots
- Enhanced GitHub issue resolution
- Workflow automation and CI/CD integration
- Web-based passive income expansion

See `mcp_usage_examples.py` for detailed usage patterns and integration examples.
