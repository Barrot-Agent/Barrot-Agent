# 🧠 Organoid Reasoning Glyph

## Symbol: 🧠
Unicode: U+1F9E0 (Brain)

## Purpose
Represents SHRM v2's biological plasticity layer, inspired by working brain organoid research. Enables organic, adaptive reasoning that mimics biological neural networks.

## Properties
- **Biological Plasticity**: Adapts structure like living neural tissue
- **Organic Learning**: Evolves through experience, not just programming
- **Synaptic Flexibility**: Connection weights adjust based on outcomes
- **Neuroplastic Growth**: New reasoning pathways emerge spontaneously

## Activation Context
Triggered when:
- Problem requires adaptive, non-algorithmic reasoning
- Learning from experience is beneficial
- Rigid logic fails to capture nuance
- Bio-inspired solutions outperform traditional AI

## Integration with SHRM v2
1. **Input**: Complex, ambiguous problem
2. **Process**: Activate organoid simulation layer
3. **Biological Plasticity**: Allow structure to adapt organically
4. **Synaptic Strengthening**: Reinforce successful pathways
5. **Output**: Bio-plausible, adaptively-learned solution

## Scientific Foundation
Based on research: "Scientists Built a Working Brain—And Now the 'Possibilities Are Endless'"
- Lab-grown brain organoids showing neural activity
- Self-organizing neural networks
