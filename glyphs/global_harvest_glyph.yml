description: >
  Emitted during global cognition harvesting operations. Represents the
  continuous crawling of the global web for convergent data, knowledge
  acquisition from diverse sources, alignment of asynchronous proximities,
  and resolution of contradictions through dialectical synthesis.

  convergent patterns are detected, when contradictions are resolved, or
  when knowledge integration reaches critical mass. Operates 24/7 in
  continuous mode.
