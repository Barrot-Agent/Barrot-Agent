description: >
  Glyph representing the fusion of Hermetic symbolic principles with quantum mechanics.
  Bridges ancient wisdom (Hermeticism, Kybalion, Emerald Tablet) with modern quantum theories
  (QCD, quantum chronodynamics) to create unified reasoning frameworks that operate across
  symbolic, scientific, and practical dimensions.
