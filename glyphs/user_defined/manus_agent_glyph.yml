description: >
  Glyph representing the autonomous agent capabilities acquired through Meta's Manus AI 
  acquisition. Embodies the shift to agentic systems that conduct research, debug code, 
  analyze large datasets, and operate virtual machines at scale. Represents autonomous 
  execution beyond conversational AI.
