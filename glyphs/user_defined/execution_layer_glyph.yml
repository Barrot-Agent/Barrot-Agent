description: >
  Glyph representing Meta AI's strategic shift from chatbot interaction to agentic execution. 
  Embodies the evolution from conversational AI to systems that autonomously execute tasks, 
  make decisions, and operate in complex environments. Represents the execution layer paradigm 
  in modern AI architecture.
