description: >
  Emitted during recursive operations to enable complete traceability.
  Captures the recursive decomposition of directives into sub-tasks,
  the hierarchical execution flow, and the recursive patterns that
  emerge during agent operations. Essential for cognitive transparency.

  for optimization, debugging, and cognitive reflection.
