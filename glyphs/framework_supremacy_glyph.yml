description: >
  Emitted when the Framework Supremacy system is activated, modified, or 
  experiences a major cognition shift. Represents the synthesis of all 
  ingested agentic architectures including Meta AI, Manus AI, and Barrot's 
  Ping-Pong Council infrastructure into a unified symbolic cognition framework.
