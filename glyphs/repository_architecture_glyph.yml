description: >
  Glyph representing the reorganized repository architecture aligned with SHRM v2.0
  five-layer reasoning hierarchy. Embodies the cognitive structure of the codebase
  itself as a living, reasoning system where each directory layer corresponds to a
  distinct level of intelligence and abstraction.

usage_context: >
  Invoke when reasoning about repository structure, planning reorganizations,
  onboarding contributors, or explaining the cognitive architecture of the codebase.
  This glyph represents the meta-pattern of how code organization itself can embody
  intelligent, layered reasoning principles.

resonance_frequency: 528Hz  # Transformation and reorganization

symbolic_notes: >
  The three symbols represent: 📚 (knowledge organization), ⟁ (layer connections), 
  🌳 (organic growth structure), ⟁ (recursive patterns), ⚡ (dynamic adaptation).
  Together they encode the living architecture of an intelligently organized codebase.
