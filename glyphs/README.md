# Glyphs

This directory contains symbolic glyphs that represent SHRM v2.0 reasoning operators.

## What are Glyphs?

Glyphs are symbolic encodings of reasoning operations that combine:
- Visual symbols for quick recognition
- Semantic encodings of operations
- Operational semantics for execution
- Philosophical and scientific correspondences

## Available Glyphs

### Temporal Plasticity Glyph (⧖⇄∿)
**File**: `temporal_plasticity_glyph.yml`

Enables flexible temporal reasoning, allowing the system to:
- Revisit past decisions with new context
- Maintain temporal coherence
- Project future scenarios
- Integrate quantum time concepts

**Hermetic Correspondence**: Rhythm principle  
**Quantum Correspondence**: Quantum time theories

### Organoid Reasoning Glyph (🧠⟲◬)
**File**: `organoid_reasoning_glyph.yml`

Enables bio-inspired computation based on working-brain organoid concepts:
- Self-organizing reasoning structures
- Autonomous skill learning
- Energy-efficient processing
- Living computational patterns

**Integration**: Integral AI principles  
**Source**: Working brain organoid research

### Hermetic Quantum Fusion Glyph (∴⚛⊕☿)
**File**: `hermetic_quantum_fusion_glyph.yml`

Bridges symbolic wisdom with quantum science:
- Maps Hermetic principles to quantum phenomena
- Treats contradictions as polarities
- Generates insights from wisdom-science fusion
- Creates multi-dimensional understanding

**Hermetic Sources**: Kybalion, Emerald Tablet  
**Quantum Sources**: QCD, quantum time theories

## Glyph Structure

Each glyph file contains:

1. **Metadata**: Name, symbol, type, version
2. **Semantic Encoding**: What the glyph represents
3. **Operational Semantics**: How the glyph operates (inputs, transformations, outputs)
4. **Applications**: Real-world use cases
5. **Correspondences**: Hermetic and/or quantum mappings
6. **Invocation**: How to use the glyph in practice

## Adding New Glyphs

New glyphs can be generated from:
- Contradiction vectors (polarity-based insights)
- Quantum-hermetic fusion discoveries
- Emergent properties in simulations
- Cross-domain conceptual bridges

Future glyphs may include:
- Platform orchestration operators
- Scale-based learning glyphs
- Multi-dimensional reasoning symbols
- Autonomous mastery indicators
