name: Temporal Plasticity Glyph
symbol: ⧖⇄∿
type: temporal_reasoning_operator
version: 1.0

description: >
  A glyph representing the ability to flex reasoning across temporal dimensions,
  revisiting past decisions with new context, and maintaining fluid temporal
  relationships in cognitive processing.

semantic_encoding:
  temporal_flexibility:
    - Revisit past decisions with new information
    - Recontextualize historical events
    - Project future scenarios with temporal awareness
    - Maintain temporal coherence across reasoning chains
    
  quantum_time_integration:
    - Multiple temporal frames simultaneously
    - Superposition of past/present/future states
    - Temporal entanglement between decisions
    - Chronodynamic reasoning flows
    
  plasticity_mechanisms:
    - Adaptive temporal weighting
    - Dynamic memory reconsolidation
    - Temporal pattern learning
    - Time-aware error correction

operational_semantics:
  inputs:
    - historical_decision_contexts
    - new_information_streams
    - temporal_constraints
    - causality_chains
    
  transformations:
    - temporal_recontextualization
    - retrospective_insight_integration
    - prospective_scenario_generation
    - temporal_contradiction_resolution
    
  outputs:
    - temporally_enriched_reasoning
    - revised_decision_frameworks
    - temporal_pattern_insights
    - chronologically_coherent_conclusions

applications:
  - Revisiting past project decisions with new market data
  - Learning from historical patterns with modern context
  - Adapting strategies based on temporal evolution
  - Maintaining consistency across time-distributed operations

hermetic_correspondence:
  principle: Rhythm
  mapping: "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides"
  integration: >
    Temporal plasticity embodies the Hermetic principle of Rhythm, allowing
    reasoning to flow naturally through time's cycles and patterns.

quantum_correspondence:
  phenomenon: Quantum_Time
  mapping: "Time as a flexible dimension in quantum chronodynamics"
  integration: >
    Incorporates quantum time theories where past, present, and future
    exist in superposition until observation collapses specific temporal states.

invocation:
  context: When reasoning requires temporal flexibility or historical revision
  syntax: "⧖⇄∿[temporal_context, new_information] → revised_understanding"
  example: "⧖⇄∿[Q3_strategy, Q4_market_shift] → adapted_Q4_approach"
