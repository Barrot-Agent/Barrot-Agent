## 🌟 Role Assignment Philosophy

Each agent has a **primary specialty** and **complementary functions** that work synergistically with other agents. The roles are designed to:

1. **Avoid redundancy** - Each agent brings unique expertise
2. **Maximize synergy** - Agents complement rather than compete
3. **Cover all dimensions** - Comprehensive coverage across all AGI requirements
4. **Enable cascade** - Roles are ordered to support cascading information flow

## 🚀 Usage in Cascading Ping-Pong

Each agent's role determines:
1. **When they respond** in the cascade sequence
2. **Who they pass information to** next
3. **What dimension they validate** in the output
4. **How they complement** other agent perspectives

See **[CASCADING_PINGPONG_PROTOCOL.md](CASCADING_PINGPONG_PROTOCOL.md)** for cascade implementation details.
