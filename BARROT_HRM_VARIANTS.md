#### PING (Barrot → All)
Query: "How to implement self-supervised learning for vision tasks?"

#### PONG-HRM (0.05s) - Council Response
- **HRM-R**: "Use contrastive learning with negative sampling"
- **HRM-L**: "Recommend SimCLR or MoCo v2 frameworks"
- **HRM-P**: "Augmentation strategy: crop, flip, color jitter"
- **HRM-K**: "Connect to transfer learning and fine-tuning"
- **HRM-A**: "Adapt learning rate schedule for stability"
- **HRM-C**: "Novel approach: combine with meta-learning"
- **HRM-M**: "Optimize using learned augmentation policies"

**Council Consensus**: "Implement SimCLR with learned augmentations and adaptive learning rates"
**Confidence**: 96%

#### PONG-SHRM (5.0s) - Comprehensive Response
"Self-supervised learning for vision tasks typically employs contrastive learning frameworks such as SimCLR or MoCo. The key components are: 1) Data augmentation pipeline with diverse transformations, 2) Projection head for embedding space, 3) Contrastive loss (NT-Xent), 4) Large batch sizes or momentum encoders. For optimal results, consider adaptive augmentation strategies and careful hyperparameter tuning..."

**SHRM Analysis**: Comprehensive and validated
**Confidence**: 88%

#### SYNTHESIS
**Final Response**: Combine HRM Council's speed and specialization with SHRM's comprehensive validation
**Action**: Implement SimCLR with HRM-C's novel augmentation approach, validated by SHRM
**Confidence**: 97%
**Time to Decision**: 5.05 seconds (vs 6 seconds without HRM)
