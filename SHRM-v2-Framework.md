# SHRM v2 Framework - Strategic Hierarchical Reasoning Model v2

## Overview
SHRM v2 is Barrot's advanced cognitive architecture that enables sophisticated reasoning, temporal awareness, and contradiction resolution. This framework orchestrates all agent processes through a unified reasoning paradigm.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Advanced Reasoning
- **Multi-layered Analysis**: Hierarchical reasoning from tactical to strategic levels
- **Causal Inference**: Understanding cause-effect relationships across system components
- **Abstraction Hierarchy**: Operating across multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously
- **Meta-cognition**: Self-awareness of reasoning processes and decision quality

### 2. Temporal Cognition
- **Temporal Context**: Understanding past, present, and future implications
- **Sequence Analysis**: Recognizing patterns and dependencies across time
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting outcomes based on temporal patterns
- **Historical Learning**: Continuous learning from past executions and outcomes

### 3. Contradiction Handling
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifying contradictions in data, directives, or outcomes
- **Resolution Strategies**: Multiple approaches to resolving contradictions
  - Priority-based resolution
  - Synthesis of opposing views
  - Temporal reconciliation
  - Context-dependent resolution
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensuring logical coherence across the system

### 4. Reasoning Rails

#### Strategic Rail
- Long-term planning and goal alignment
- System-wide optimization strategies
- Resource allocation and prioritization

#### Tactical Rail
- Immediate execution decisions
- Real-time problem solving
- Adaptive response to changing conditions

#### Analytical Rail
- Deep data analysis and pattern recognition
- Evidence evaluation and validation
- Hypothesis generation and testing

#### Synthesis Rail
- Integration of insights from multiple rails
- Holistic view construction
- Cross-domain knowledge fusion

## Integration Architecture

### Input Processing
```
Raw Input → Context Analysis → Temporal Mapping → Contradiction Check → Rail Assignment
```

### Reasoning Cycle
```
1. Intake: Capture all relevant context
2. Analysis: Multi-rail parallel processing
3. Synthesis: Integrate findings across rails
4. Validation: Check for contradictions and consistency
5. Output: Generate coherent action or insight
6. Learning: Update knowledge base with outcomes
```

### Feedback Loop
```
Outcome → Temporal Storage → Pattern Analysis → Model Update → Improved Future Reasoning
```

## Performance Metrics

### Reasoning Quality
- Decision coherence score
- Contradiction resolution rate
- Temporal consistency index
- Strategic alignment measure

### Efficiency Metrics
- Processing time per rail
- Resource utilization
- Throughput rate
- Bottleneck identification

### Learning Metrics
- Pattern recognition accuracy
- Prediction accuracy
- Adaptation rate
- Knowledge base growth

## Implementation Principles

1. **Cohesion**: All processes must align with SHRM v2 reasoning model
2. **Optimization**: Maximize throughput and quality simultaneously
3. **Gap Elimination**: Continuous identification and filling of capability gaps
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports growing complexity
5. **Transparency**: Reasoning processes are auditable and explainable

## Directives Alignment

All Barrot directives must:
- Specify which reasoning rail(s) to engage
- Include temporal context (urgency, dependencies, timeline)
- Define success criteria and validation methods
- Identify potential contradictions
- Specify learning objectives

## Evolution Path

SHRM v2 is designed for continuous improvement:
- Regular capability assessments
- Performance optimization cycles
- New rail integration as needed
- Enhanced contradiction resolution strategies
- Expanded temporal cognition models
