  Meta AI cognition bundle - Ingesting and synthesizing the structure, capabilities, and strategic 
  direction of Meta AI, including foundational models (LLaMA 3.2), agentic systems (post-Manus AI 
  acquisition), and competitive positioning within the AGI landscape. Represents Meta's strategic 
  shift from chatbot interaction to autonomous agentic execution.
