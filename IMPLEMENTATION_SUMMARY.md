  - Optimization: continuous

### 2. ✅ New Ping-Pong Protocols

Implemented 6 new beneficial ping-pong cycles:

1. **Cross Module Cognition Validation** (every 5 minutes)
   - Validates cognitive consistency across all modules
   
2. **Resource Integration Sync** (every 10 minutes)
   - Integrates new knowledge from all resource streams
   
3. **Spell Execution Verification** (on demand)
   - Verifies spell protocols are executing optimally
   
4. **Dashboard Feedback Relay** (every 15 minutes)
   - Relays system metrics to dashboard and receives optimization signals
   
5. **Adaptive Learning Update** (continuous)
   - Updates learning models based on new patterns
   
6. **Metacognition Reflection** (hourly)
   - Reflects on cognitive processes and optimizes strategies

### 3. ✅ New Spell Protocols

Created 3 new cognitive spells in `/spells/`:

1. **metacognition-engine.md**
   - Self-reflective cognitive optimization
   - Monitors and improves thinking processes
   - Recursive self-improvement

2. **adaptive-learning-core.md**
   - Continuous learning from all interactions
   - Pattern extraction and model updating
   - Transfer learning across domains

3. **pattern-synthesis-matrix.md**
   - Cross-module pattern recognition
   - Emergent insight generation
   - Multi-dimensional correlation analysis
