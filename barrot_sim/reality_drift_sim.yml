description: >
  Symbolic divergence detection simulation. Monitors and models the drift
  between symbolic representations and underlying reality, detecting when
  abstractions lose fidelity and require recalibration.

  faithful to actual system behavior and outcomes, triggering recalibration
  when abstractions lose fidelity with reality.
