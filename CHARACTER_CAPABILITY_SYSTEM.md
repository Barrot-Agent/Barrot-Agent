# Character Capability Dynamic Search & Analysis System

## Overview

The Character Capability Dynamic Search & Analysis System enables Barrot to dynamically search for, analyze, and transform fictional character abilities into real-world, actionable capabilities. This system provides a comprehensive framework for identifying character powers across multiple genres and mapping them to practical technology implementations.

## Key Features

✅ **Dynamic Character Analysis** - Analyze characters from movies, books, TV shows, comics, cartoons, video games, and historical sources

✅ **Capability Transformation** - Transform fictional abilities into real-world framework features

✅ **Cross-Genre Synthesis** - Combine capabilities from multiple characters across different genres

✅ **Similar Character Suggestions** - Automatically suggest related characters based on capability categories

✅ **Priority & Impact Assessment** - Evaluate implementation priority and estimated impact for each capability

✅ **Export & Integration** - Export character data in JSON and Markdown formats for easy integration

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Character Analysis

```python
from character_capability_analyzer import create_character_database

# Load character database
analyzer = create_character_database()

# Analyze a specific character
dr_strange = analyzer.characters["Dr. Strange"]

print(f"Character: {dr_strange.name}")
print(f"Genre: {dr_strange.genre.value}")

for cap in dr_strange.capabilities:
    print(f"  - {cap.name}: {cap.framework_feature}")
```

### Example 2: Find Characters by Capability Category

```python
from character_capability_analyzer import create_character_database, CapabilityCategory

analyzer = create_character_database()

# Find all characters with temporal capabilities
for character in analyzer.characters.values():
    for cap in character.capabilities:
        if cap.category == CapabilityCategory.TEMPORAL:
            print(f"{character.name}: {cap.name}")
```

### Example 3: Get Similar Character Suggestions

```python
from character_capability_analyzer import create_character_database

analyzer = create_character_database()

# Get suggestions based on a character
character = analyzer.characters["Kakashi Hatake"]
suggestions = analyzer.suggest_similar_characters(character)

print(f"Characters similar to {character.name}:")
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"  - {suggestion}")
```

### Example 4: Add Custom Characters

```python
from character_capability_analyzer import (
    CharacterCapabilityAnalyzer,
    Character,
    Capability,
    CharacterGenre,
    CapabilityCategory
)

analyzer = CharacterCapabilityAnalyzer()

# Create a custom character
custom_character = Character(
    name="Your Character",
    genre=CharacterGenre.MOVIES,
    source="Your Source",
    first_appearance="2024",
    overview="Character description",
    capabilities=[
        Capability(
            name="Super Power",
            description="Power description",
            category=CapabilityCategory.PHYSICAL,
            fictional_aspect="Fictional power",
            real_world_mapping="Real-world tech",
            framework_feature="Framework Feature Name",
            implementation_priority="high",
            estimated_impact="transformative"
        )
    ]
)

analyzer.add_character(custom_character)
```

### Example 5: Export Data

```python
from character_capability_analyzer import create_character_database

analyzer = create_character_database()

# Generate summary report
report = analyzer.generate_summary_report()
print(f"Total Characters: {report['total_characters']}")

**Framework Feature**: Time Series Analysis Engine  
**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: Transformative

    source="Source Material",
    first_appearance="Year",
    overview="Character description",
    capabilities=[...]  # List of capabilities
)
```

2. **Add to analyzer**:
```python
analyzer.add_character(new_character)
```

3. **Generate profile**:
```python
analyzer.save_character_profile(new_character)

## Advanced Features

### 1. Capability Search
Search for specific capabilities by keyword:
```python
analyzer = create_character_database()

# Search for "distributed" capabilities
for char in analyzer.characters.values():
    for cap in char.capabilities:
        if "distributed" in cap.framework_feature.lower():
            print(f"{char.name}: {cap.framework_feature}")
```

### 2. Impact Assessment
Filter by impact level:
```python
report = analyzer.generate_summary_report()

# Get all revolutionary features
revolutionary = [
    f for f in report['transformative_impacts'] 
    if f['impact'] == 'revolutionary'
]
```

### 3. Priority Filtering
Find critical priority features:
```python
critical_features = [
    f for f in report['high_priority_features']
    if f['priority'] == 'critical'
]
```
