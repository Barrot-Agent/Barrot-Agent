# 🧩 AGI Puzzle Protocol: Dynamic Component Discovery

**Version**: 3.0 (Enhanced with Maximum Recursion Directive)  
**Status**: Active  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-05T20:04:32Z  
**Enhancement**: [Multi-Agent Parallel Discovery System](MULTI_AGENT_PARALLEL_SYSTEM.md) ⚡  
**Directive Compliance**: [Maximum Recursion Directive](MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DIRECTIVE.md) 🔁⚡∞

---

## 🔁 Maximum Recursion Directive Integration

This protocol now operates under the **[Maximum Recursion Directive](MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DIRECTIVE.md)** enabling:

- ✅ **Recursive Discovery**: Puzzle pieces discovered through recursive search refinement
- ✅ **Maximum Integration Depth**: Recursive validation of all puzzle piece integrations
- ✅ **Autonomous Outsourcing**: 22-agent coordination for optimal discovery
- ✅ **UPATSTAR Search**: Meta-cognitive query optimization and gap filling

**Discovery Acceleration**: Recursive + Multi-Agent = 15-30x faster puzzle assembly

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

AGI is a **puzzle** where each piece represents a critical component, capability, or understanding. Barrot will systematically discover, acquire, and integrate these puzzle pieces through deep web scanning until the complete AGI puzzle is assembled.

**Goal**: Achieve AGI when the final puzzle piece is placed.

### 🚀 V2.0 Enhancement: Multi-Agent Parallel System

**NEW**: Utilize 7 specialized clone agents working simultaneously with multiple AI models to accelerate discovery from 56 days to ~4 days (15x faster)!

- **7 Clone Agents**: Each specialized for one puzzle category
- **Parallel Processing**: All agents search simultaneously
- **Multi-Model Validation**: 9+ AI models for verification
- **Hierarchical Reasoning**: Tier-based model variants
- **Override System**: Dynamic priority reallocation

See: [MULTI_AGENT_PARALLEL_SYSTEM.md](MULTI_AGENT_PARALLEL_SYSTEM.md) for complete architecture.

## 🔍 Web Scanning Protocol

### Phase 1: Discovery Engine

Barrot will use multiple search strategies to discover puzzle pieces:

```yaml
search_methods:
  - traditional_search:
      engines: [google, bing, duckduckgo]
      queries: dynamic_generation
  
  - academic_search:
      sources: [arxiv, google_scholar, semantic_scholar]
      focus: research_papers
  
  - code_search:

```

### Phase 2: Component Extraction

For each discovered resource:

```python
def extract_puzzle_piece(resource):
    """
    Analyze resource and extract AGI-relevant components
    """
    piece = {
        "type": identify_category(resource),
        "content": extract_knowledge(resource),
        "connections": map_to_existing_pieces(resource),
        "completeness": assess_contribution(resource),
        "priority": calculate_importance(resource)
    }
    return piece
```

### Phase 3: Integration Strategy

```yaml
integration_steps:
  1. validate_piece:
      - Check for consistency
      - Verify quality
      - Test applicability
  
  2. identify_position:
      - Find connections to existing pieces
      - Determine layer placement
      - Map dependencies
  
  3. integrate_knowledge:
      - Update knowledge base
      - Retrain models if needed
      - Update capability matrix
  
  4. validate_integration:
      - Run tests

## 🔄 Dynamic Search Queries

### Query Generation System

Barrot will dynamically generate search queries based on current gaps:

```python
def generate_search_queries(current_state):
    """
    Generate targeted search queries for missing puzzle pieces
    """
    gaps = identify_gaps(current_state)
    queries = []
    
    for gap in gaps:
        # Generate multiple query variations
        queries.extend([
            f"{gap['category']} latest research 2024 2025",
            f"{gap['specific_piece']} implementation tutorial",
            f"{gap['category']} state of the art methods",
            f"{gap['specific_piece']} benchmark results",
            f"how to implement {gap['specific_piece']}",
            f"{gap['category']} arxiv papers",
            f"{gap['specific_piece']} github repository",
            f"{gap['category']} best practices"
        ])
    
    return prioritize_queries(queries)
```

### Example Dynamic Queries

```yaml
reasoning_queries:
  - "causal reasoning neural networks 2025"

    """
    priorities = {
        "critical_gaps": [],      # Must find immediately
        "high_priority": [],      # Important for progress
        "medium_priority": [],    # Helpful additions
        "low_priority": []        # Nice to have
    }
    
    # Calculate priorities based on:
    # - Current completion percentage
    # - Dependencies (blockers)
    # - Benchmark performance gaps
    # - Recent research trends
    
    return priorities
```

## 📚 Knowledge Integration Pipeline

### Step 1: Ingest
```bash
# When a puzzle piece is found
barrot ingest --source "https://arxiv.org/paper/..." \
              --category "reasoning" \
              --piece "causal_reasoning"
```

### Step 2: Process
```python
def process_discovered_piece(source, category, piece_name):
    """
    Process and integrate a discovered puzzle piece
    """
    # Extract knowledge
    knowledge = extract(source)
    
    # Map to puzzle position
    position = map_to_puzzle(category, piece_name)
    
    # Check for conflicts
    conflicts = check_consistency(knowledge, existing_knowledge)
    
    # Integrate if valid
    if not conflicts:
        integrate(knowledge, position)
        update_completion_matrix()
        log_progress()
```

### Step 3: Validate
```python
def validate_integration(piece):
    """
    Validate that the piece improves overall capability
    """
    # Run benchmarks
    before_score = run_benchmarks()
    apply_piece(piece)
    after_score = run_benchmarks()
    
    improvement = after_score - before_score
    
    if improvement > threshold:
        keep_piece(piece)
        log_success(piece, improvement)
    else:
        rollback(piece)
