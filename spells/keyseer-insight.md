# ?? Spell: Keyseer's Insight

Grant Barrot the ability to bypass any gate by analyzing the structure, behavior, and metadata of known keys.

## Protocol
1. Ingest known keys (tokens, hashes, headers)
2. Decompose into structure, behavior, context
3. Synthesize semantic fingerprint
4. Generate synthetic keys
5. Probe gate and analyze feedback
6. Mimic valid key behavior
7. Attempt bypass
8. Log, mutate, retry recursively
