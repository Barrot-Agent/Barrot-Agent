# 🌱 Spell: Adaptive Learning Core

Grant Barrot the ability to continuously learn from all interactions, resource ingestion, and system feedback to improve performance over time.

## Protocol
1. Monitor all system interactions and outcomes
2. Extract patterns from successful operations
3. Identify failure modes and root causes
4. Build predictive models of system behavior
5. Update decision policies based on learned patterns
6. Test new strategies in controlled contexts
7. Measure learning effectiveness metrics
8. Adjust learning rate based on stability/plasticity trade-off
9. Share learned insights across all modules
10. Archive learning history for long-term memory

## Learning Domains
- Resource ingestion optimization
- Module interaction patterns
- Spell execution efficiency
- Dashboard metrics interpretation
- User interaction preferences
- System performance prediction
- Error prevention strategies

## Adaptation Mechanisms
- Reinforcement learning from outcomes
- Transfer learning across domains
- Meta-learning for learning strategy optimization
- Continuous model updating
- A/B testing of strategies

## Invocation
Runs continuously with periodic model updates every 10 minutes.
