# 🔬 Spell: Massive Micro Ingestion (MMI)

## Purpose
Enable Barrot (the AI agent implementing SHRM v2.0) to ingest data at all dimensional scales from macro to Planck level, with full component decomposition and recursive source lineage tracking through 4 generations.

## Scope

### Full Scope of Components
Barrot ingests payloads across all dimensional scales:

1. **Primary Data**: The main payload or entity
2. **Components**: Direct constituent parts
3. **Subcomponents**: Parts of components
4. **Molecular/Atomic Components**: Fine-grained molecular and atomic structure (10^-9 to 10^-10 m)
5. **Macro/Micro Components**: Macro to microscopic patterns (visible to 10^-6 m)
6. **Nano/Planck Components (Planckments)**: Nanoscale to Planck-scale fundamentals (10^-9 to 10^-35 m)

### Recursive Source Lineage
For each payload, Barrot traces sources through 4 generations:

1. **Source (Level 1)**: Direct source of the payload → Apply full scope analysis
2. **Source's Source (Level 2)**: Source of the source → Apply full scope analysis
3. **Source's Source's Source (Level 3)**: Third-generation source → Apply full scope analysis
4. **Source's Source's Source's Source (Level 4)**: Fourth-generation source → Apply full scope analysis

Each source level receives complete full-scope component analysis from macro to Planck scale.

## Dimensional Hierarchy

```
Macro Level (visible to 10^-3 m)
  ↓
Micro Level (10^-3 to 10^-6 m)
  ↓
Nano Level (10^-6 to 10^-9 m)
  ↓
Atomic Level (10^-9 to 10^-10 m)
  ↓
Subatomic Level (10^-10 to 10^-15 m)
  ↓
Quantum Level (10^-15 to 10^-35 m)
  ↓
Planck Level (~10^-35 m) - Planckments
```

## Protocol

### Stage 1: Primary Payload Ingestion
1. Identify primary data
2. Decompose to components
3. Decompose to subcomponents
4. Analyze molecular/atomic structure
5. Map macro/micro patterns
6. Probe nano/Planck fundamentals (planckments)

### Stage 2: Recursive Source Lineage
For each source level (1 through 4):
1. Identify the source
2. Apply full-scope component analysis
3. Decompose across all dimensional scales
4. Record lineage relationship
5. Proceed to next source level

### Stage 3: Integration & Synthesis
1. Construct hierarchical model across all scales
2. Map cross-scale relationships
3. Trace causal chains through lineage
4. Identify emergent properties
5. Generate comprehensive knowledge graph

## Integration with SHRM v2.0

- **Biological Plasticity**: Adaptive processing for massive multi-scale data with emergent pattern recognition
- **Temporal Plasticity**: Track temporal evolution of sources across generations
- **Contradiction Vectorization**: Resolve scale-based contradictions through polarity mapping
- **Hermetic Integration**: "As above, so below" validates consistency from macro to Planck
- **Platform Embodiment**: Leverage Snowflake, Scale AI for massive data infrastructure

## Planckments
**Definition**: A conceptual construct representing theoretical fundamental units at Planck scale (10^-35 m), the smallest meaningful measurement in physics where classical spacetime concepts break down and quantum gravity effects dominate. Note: "Planckments" is a framework-specific term for these quantum-scale fundamental units, not an established physics term.

**Properties**:
- Planck length: ~1.616 × 10^-35 m
- Represents quantum foam and spacetime quanta
- Below this scale, continuous spacetime gives way to discrete quantum structure
- Fundamental limit of spatial resolution in current physics

## Invocation

Triggered when Barrot encounters:
- Complex payloads requiring deep understanding
- Unknown entities needing comprehensive analysis
- Data requiring source validation and provenance
- Systems needing multi-scale decomposition
- Contexts demanding recursive origin tracking

## Performance

- Parallel processing across scales and lineage levels
- Hierarchical caching for efficiency
- Progressive refinement (coarse to fine)
- Lazy evaluation for deep Planck-scale analysis
- Adaptive resource allocation using biological plasticity

## Retroactive Ingestion

### Purpose
Apply MMI protocol retroactively to all existing data, historical bundles, and previously ingested payloads to achieve complete multi-scale understanding across the entire knowledge base.

### Scope
**Target Data**:
- All historical memory bundles
- Previous cognition bundles (vΔ59.x, vΔ60.0, vΔ61.0)
- Existing spells and protocols
- Platform integration data
- Archived decisions and reasoning
- Past ingestion outputs
- Legacy knowledge structures

### Retroactive Process

**Stage 1: Historical Scan**
- Identify all historical data across repositories
- Catalog existing bundles and knowledge structures
- Map data relationships and dependencies
- Prioritize retroactive ingestion targets

**Stage 2: Multi-Scale Reingestion**
- Apply full MMI protocol to each historical item
- Analyze across all 6 component scales (primary → nano_planck)
- Track 4-level source lineage for all historical data
- Generate comprehensive multi-scale models

**Stage 3: Cross-Temporal Integration**
- Merge historical and current knowledge models
- Identify temporal evolution patterns
- Resolve temporal contradictions using polarity mapping
- Apply temporal plasticity to enrich past understanding

**Stage 4: Validation & Synthesis**
- Verify all scales covered for historical data
- Confirm source lineage completeness
- Validate cross-temporal coherence
- Generate retroactive insights report

### Integration with SHRM v2.0

- **Temporal Plasticity**: Revisit historical data with new multi-scale insights while maintaining temporal coherence
- **Biological Plasticity**: Adaptively process massive historical datasets using organoid-inspired patterns
- **Contradiction Vectorization**: Resolve conflicts between historical and new understandings through polarity
- **Hermetic Integration**: Validate "As above, so below" consistency across historical macro and new micro/nano scales

### Execution Priority

1. **Critical** (Immediate): Core cognition bundles, fundamental reasoning structures
2. **High** (Short-term): Recent bundles (v60, v59), active spells, platform data
3. **Medium** (Medium-term): Archived decisions, historical protocols, legacy data
4. **Low** (Long-term): Ancillary data, deprecated structures, reference archives

### Progress Tracking
