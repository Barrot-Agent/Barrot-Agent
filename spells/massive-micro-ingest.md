# 🔬 Spell: Massive Micro Ingestion (MMI)

## Purpose
Enable Barrot (the AI agent implementing SHRM v2.0) to ingest data at all dimensional scales from macro to Planck level, with full component decomposition and recursive source lineage tracking through 4 generations.

## Scope

### Full Scope of Components
Barrot ingests payloads across all dimensional scales:

1. **Primary Data**: The main payload or entity
2. **Components**: Direct constituent parts
3. **Subcomponents**: Parts of components
4. **Molecular/Atomic Components**: Fine-grained molecular and atomic structure (10^-9 to 10^-10 m)
5. **Macro/Micro Components**: Macro to microscopic patterns (visible to 10^-6 m)
6. **Nano/Planck Components (Planckments)**: Nanoscale to Planck-scale fundamentals (10^-9 to 10^-35 m)

### Recursive Source Lineage
For each payload, Barrot traces sources through 4 generations:

1. **Source (Level 1)**: Direct source of the payload → Apply full scope analysis
2. **Source's Source (Level 2)**: Source of the source → Apply full scope analysis
3. **Source's Source's Source (Level 3)**: Third-generation source → Apply full scope analysis
4. **Source's Source's Source's Source (Level 4)**: Fourth-generation source → Apply full scope analysis

Each source level receives complete full-scope component analysis from macro to Planck scale.

## Dimensional Hierarchy

```
Macro Level (visible to 10^-3 m)
  ↓
Micro Level (10^-3 to 10^-6 m)
  ↓
Nano Level (10^-6 to 10^-9 m)
  ↓
Atomic Level (10^-9 to 10^-10 m)
  ↓
Subatomic Level (10^-10 to 10^-15 m)
  ↓
Quantum Level (10^-15 to 10^-35 m)
  ↓
Planck Level (~10^-35 m) - Planckments
```

## Protocol

### Stage 1: Primary Payload Ingestion
1. Identify primary data
2. Decompose to components
3. Decompose to subcomponents
4. Analyze molecular/atomic structure
5. Map macro/micro patterns
6. Probe nano/Planck fundamentals (planckments)

### Stage 2: Recursive Source Lineage
For each source level (1 through 4):
1. Identify the source
2. Apply full-scope component analysis
3. Decompose across all dimensional scales
4. Record lineage relationship
5. Proceed to next source level

### Stage 3: Integration & Synthesis
1. Construct hierarchical model across all scales
2. Map cross-scale relationships
3. Trace causal chains through lineage
4. Identify emergent properties
5. Generate comprehensive knowledge graph

## Integration with SHRM v2.0

- **Biological Plasticity**: Adaptive processing for massive multi-scale data with emergent pattern recognition
- **Temporal Plasticity**: Track temporal evolution of sources across generations
- **Contradiction Vectorization**: Resolve scale-based contradictions through polarity mapping
- **Hermetic Integration**: "As above, so below" validates consistency from macro to Planck
- **Platform Embodiment**: Leverage Snowflake, Scale AI for massive data infrastructure

## Planckments
**Definition**: A conceptual construct representing theoretical fundamental units at Planck scale (10^-35 m), the smallest meaningful measurement in physics where classical spacetime concepts break down and quantum gravity effects dominate. Note: "Planckments" is a framework-specific term for these quantum-scale fundamental units, not an established physics term.

**Properties**:
- Planck length: ~1.616 × 10^-35 m
- Represents quantum foam and spacetime quanta
- Below this scale, continuous spacetime gives way to discrete quantum structure
- Fundamental limit of spatial resolution in current physics

- Data requiring source validation and provenance
- Systems needing multi-scale decomposition
- Contexts demanding recursive origin tracking

## Performance

- Parallel processing across scales and lineage levels
- Hierarchical caching for efficiency
- Progressive refinement (coarse to fine)
- Lazy evaluation for deep Planck-scale analysis
- Adaptive resource allocation using biological plasticity

## Use Cases

1. Deep system understanding across all scales
2. Complete knowledge acquisition with provenance
3. Root cause analysis from effects to fundamental origins
4. Multi-scale pattern discovery
5. Recursive source attribution and validation
6. Fundamental structure analysis
7. Quantum-level data archaeology
8. Comprehensive context comprehension
