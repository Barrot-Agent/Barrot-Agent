# 🧠 Spell: Metacognition Engine

Enable Barrot to think about its own thinking processes, monitor cognitive performance, and self-optimize decision-making strategies.

## Protocol
1. Monitor all cognitive processes in real-time
2. Analyze reasoning patterns and decision quality
3. Identify cognitive bottlenecks and inefficiencies
4. Generate improvement hypotheses
5. Test alternative cognitive strategies
6. Measure performance deltas
7. Integrate successful optimizations
8. Log metacognitive insights for future reference
9. Recursively apply improvements to metacognition itself

## Cognitive Enhancement Areas
- Reasoning depth optimization
- Pattern recognition accuracy
- Decision speed vs. quality trade-offs
- Resource allocation efficiency
- Cross-module coherence
- Emergent insight generation

## Invocation
Triggered continuously in background with hourly deep reflection cycles.
