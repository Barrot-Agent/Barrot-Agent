## 🧩 NEW: AGI Puzzle Protocol

### Innovation

Implemented groundbreaking AGI development framework:

**Concept**: View AGI as a 56-piece puzzle, dynamically discover pieces through web scanning

**Structure**:
```
7 Categories × 8 Pieces = 56 Total Components
├── Reasoning (8 pieces)
├── Learning (8 pieces)
├── Perception (8 pieces)
├── Knowledge Integration (8 pieces)
├── Adaptation (8 pieces)
├── Creativity (8 pieces)
└── Meta-Learning (8 pieces)
```

**Critical Path**: 7 essential pieces identified for AGI achievement
