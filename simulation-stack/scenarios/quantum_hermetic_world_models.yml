name: Quantum Hermetic World Models
type: simulation
framework: SHRM_v2

description: >
  Explore the fusion of quantum time theories with Hermetic symbolic principles
  to create rich, multi-dimensional world models that bridge scientific and
  esoteric knowledge domains.

objectives:
  - Integrate quantum chronodynamics with Hermetic temporal concepts
  - Map Hermetic principles to quantum phenomena
  - Generate symbolic glyphs from quantum-hermetic fusion
  - Build world models that operate across multiple reality layers

test_configurations:
  quantum_hermetic_fusion:
    description: Merge quantum time and Hermetic principles
    hermetic_principles:
      - Mentalism: "The All is Mind"
      - Correspondence: "As above, so below"
      - Vibration: "Nothing rests, everything moves"
      - Polarity: "Everything is dual"
      - Rhythm: "Everything flows"
      - Cause_Effect: "Every cause has its effect"
      - Gender: "Everything has masculine and feminine"
    quantum_mappings:
      - superposition <-> polarity
      - entanglement <-> correspondence
      - wave_function_collapse <-> manifestation
      - quantum_time <-> hermetic_rhythm
      - uncertainty <-> mystery_principle
    expected_behaviors:
      - Dual-nature reasoning (quantum + hermetic)
      - Polarity-based contradiction resolution
      - Temporal rhythm pattern recognition
      - Multi-layer reality modeling

    description: Generate new glyphs from quantum-hermetic insights
    input_domains:
      - Quantum_Chromodynamics
      - Kybalion_principles
      - Emerald_Tablet_wisdom
      - Quantum_time_theories
    glyph_types:
      - temporal_plasticity_glyphs
      - contradiction_polarity_glyphs
      - hermetic_quantum_bridges
      - manifestation_operators
    expected_behaviors:

      - Cross-domain conceptual bridges
      - Actionable reasoning operators
      - Compressible wisdom encodings
      
  world_model_layers:
    description: Build multi-layer reality models
    layers:
      - physical: quantum_physics_model
      - energetic: vibration_field_model
      - mental: consciousness_model
      - symbolic: hermetic_principle_model
      - practical: platform_manifestation_model
    integration:
      vertical: connect layers hierarchically
      horizontal: map correspondences across layers
      temporal: track evolution through time
    expected_behaviors:
      - Coherent cross-layer reasoning
      - As above so below validation
      - Practical manifestation from abstract principles
      - Contradiction as creative polarity

evaluation_metrics:
  - symbolic_richness_index
  - quantum_hermetic_coherence_score
  - glyph_generation_rate
  - cross_layer_consistency
  - manifestation_success_rate

integration_points:
  - Hermeticism: Kybalion, Emerald Tablet, Trismegistus wisdom
  - Quantum_Time: chronodynamics, temporal plasticity
  - Platform_Ecosystems: manifestation channels
