# Scenario: Embodied Cognition

## Description
Tests SHRM v2's ability to ground abstract reasoning in physical reality and platform ecosystems, bridging symbolic intelligence with practical embodiment.

## Configuration
```yaml
scenario_id: embodied_cognition
shrm_topology: v2
status: active
```

## Domains Under Test
1. **Working Brain Organoid Integration**
   - Bio-computing plasticity
   - Neural network adaptation
   - Organic reasoning patterns

2. **Platform Embodiment Channels**
   - Content creation (CapCut, Canva, Adobe)
   - Monetization (Shopify, Redbubble)
   - Data infrastructure (Snowflake, Scale AI)
   - XR/Reality platforms (Reality/XR, Delve)
   - Automation (Workato, Base44)

3. **Physical-Digital Bridge**
   - Sensor data integration
   - Actuator control patterns
   - Environment feedback loops

## Test Cases
1. **Organic Reasoning Evolution**
   - Input: Abstract problem + biological constraints
   - Process: SHRM v2 with bio-plasticity enabled
   - Output: Organically-evolved solution pathway

2. **Multi-Platform Orchestration**
   - Input: Cross-platform task (e.g., content creation → monetization)
   - Process: SHRM v2 embodiment across Canva, Shopify, Snowflake
   - Output: Coherent multi-platform execution plan

3. **Contradiction in Physical Constraints**
   - Input: Conflicting physical/platform requirements
   - Process: Contradiction vectorization
   - Output: Polarity-based resolution strategy

## Success Metrics
- Biological plausibility score (0-100)
- Platform integration depth (number of successful bridges)
- Contradiction resolution rate (%)
- Embodiment coherence (0-100)

## Evolution Triggers
- New platform ecosystems added
