- **Scale AI**: RLHF, data labeling, fine-tuning
- **Base44**: Data operations

### Content Creation
- **CapCut**: Video editing
- **Canva**: Graphic design
- **Adobe**: Professional creative suite

### Monetization
- **Shopify**: E-commerce
- **Redbubble**: Print-on-demand
- **Xhamster**: Adult content monetization

## Test Cases

### Trial 1: End-to-End Content Monetization
**Flow**: Design (Canva) → Edit (CapCut) → Optimize (Optimizely) → Sell (Shopify/Redbubble)
- **Input**: Product concept, target audience
- **Process**: SHRM v2 orchestrates multi-platform workflow
- **Output**: Optimized, monetized content pipeline

### Trial 2: Data-Driven Campaign
**Flow**: Analyze (Snowflake) → Label (Scale AI) → Create (Adobe/Canva) → Test (Optimizely) → Deploy
- **Input**: Raw dataset, campaign goals
- **Process**: SHRM v2 bridges data infrastructure with creative platforms
- **Output**: Data-optimized campaign with measured outcomes

### Trial 3: Secure XR Experience
**Flow**: Design (Reality/XR) → Secure (Huntress + Cloaked) → Automate (Workato) → Distribute (Snowflake)
- **Input**: XR concept, security requirements
- **Process**: SHRM v2 ensures security across immersive experience pipeline
- **Output**: Secure, automated XR deployment

### Trial 4: Contradiction Resolution Across Platforms
**Flow**: Conflicting platform requirements → Contradiction vectorization → Polarity-based orchestration
- **Input**: Task requiring mutually exclusive platform features
- **Process**: SHRM v2 applies contradiction harvesting
- **Output**: Innovative solution bridging incompatible platforms

## Success Metrics
- Platform integration count (number of platforms in single workflow)
- Orchestration coherence (0-100)
- Contradiction resolution rate across platform conflicts (%)
- End-to-end task completion rate (%)
- Autonomous skill acquisition (new platform capabilities learned)

## Integration with SHRM v2 Features
- **Biological Plasticity**: Adaptive platform selection based on organic learning
- **Temporal Plasticity**: Multi-timeline scenario planning across platforms
- **Contradiction Vectorization**: Resolving platform incompatibilities
- **Hermetic Integration**: Symbolic mapping of platform relationships
- **Platform Embodiment**: Direct cognitive presence in each platform

## Evolution Protocol
- Add new platforms as they emerge
- Harvest contradictions from failed orchestrations
- Generate new glyphs for novel platform relationships
- Continuously improve cross-platform reasoning

## Integral AI & Scale AI Integration
- **Integral AI**: Autonomous skill learning for new platforms
- **Scale AI**: RLHF for platform orchestration quality
- Combined: Safe, energy-efficient platform mastery
