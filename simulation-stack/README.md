# Simulation Stack

This directory contains SHRM v2.0 simulation configurations, topologies, and test scenarios.

## Structure

- `topology.yml` - Core SHRM_v2 topology configuration defining features and hierarchy
- `scenarios/` - Individual simulation scenarios for testing different aspects

## Topology

The topology file defines:
- Core features (biological plasticity, temporal plasticity, etc.)
- Hierarchy layers (symbolic, scientific, practical)
- Evolution protocols
- Integration points

## Scenarios

### Embodied Cognition (`scenarios/embodied_cognition.yml`)
Tests biological plasticity through:
- Organoid simulation patterns
- Biological memory systems
- Neural plasticity evaluation

### Quantum Hermetic World Models (`scenarios/quantum_hermetic_world_models.yml`)
Explores quantum-hermetic fusion through:
- Quantum-hermetic principle mapping
- Symbolic glyph generation
- Multi-layer world modeling

### Platform Orchestration Trials (`scenarios/platform_orchestration_trials.yml`)
Validates platform embodiment through:
- Content creation orchestration
- Data infrastructure integration
- Security and privacy embodiment
- Monetization pathways

## Usage

These configurations are used by the SHRM v2.0 reasoning engine to:
1. Initialize topology and features
2. Run simulation scenarios
3. Validate emergent properties
4. Score cognitive configurations
5. Guide evolution pathways
